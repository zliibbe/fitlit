// Hydration should be a class
  //  Hydration should take in user id as the parameter
//  Hydration should have a method that calculates total average water consumed
//  Hydration should have a method that calculates daily average water consumed
//  Hydration should have a method that calculated weekly average water consumedIteration 3 - Hydration


// Data
// Create classes and methods that can calculate:

// For a user(identified by their userID - this is the same for all methods requiring a specific userâ€™s data), the average fluid ounces consumed per day for all time
// For a user, how many fluid ounces they consumed for a specific day(identified by a date)
// For a user, how many fluid ounces of water consumed each day over the course of a week(7 days) - return the amount for each day
// You have to decide which classes should contain each method.Think about whose responsibility it is to own the method.
