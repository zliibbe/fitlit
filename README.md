# FitLit (Part 1)

The details of this project are outline in [this project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack
- Test Driven Development
- Mocha 
- Chai
- chart.js

## Testing

In order to run testing if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`). Run test files by typing `npm test [file path]`

### Wins
- Writing tests to guide our implementation code.
- Class structure, utilizing prototype array iterator methods
### Challenges
